  description: The Strait of Gibraltar[1] is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic
    Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Europe from Africa. The two continents
    are separated by 7.7 nautical miles (14.2 kilometers, 8.9 miles) at its narrowest
    point.[2] Ferries cross between the two continents every day in as little as
    35 minutes. The Strait's depth ranges between 300 and 900 metres (980 and 2,950
    feet; 160 and 490 fathoms).
